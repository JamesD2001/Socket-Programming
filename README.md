# Socket-Programming

## Description
This code allows for a server and clients to get a randomly generated number by having the client input their chosen number with the server adding a number from 0-100 to output a sum.

- What was your motivation? To see the behind the scenes between the two
- Why did you build this project? To better understand how server and client interact
- What did you learn? I learned that you wont get the result your looking for if you dont run the server first and that the port is very important when connecting the two

## Usage
You simply have to run the server then run the client. After running the client you will be given the chance to input a number from 1-100. Input a number within the parameters and you will get an output to the server and the client.
